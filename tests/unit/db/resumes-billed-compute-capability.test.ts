/**
 * `resumesBilledCompute` across every shipped provider.
 *
 * The capability withholds the connection pulse and the admin fleet health check from a
 * connection, and labels the monitoring auto-refresh toggle with the billing sentence. Declared
 * by an engine whose suspended compute a request resumes and bills (a Databend Cloud warehouse),
 * it keeps Studio from holding that compute awake. Declared anywhere else it would silently drop
 * the health of a connection that costs nothing to check, so this census holds every shipped
 * provider to the flag's absence on a connection that names no billed compute. Databend declares it when its
 * connection names a Warehouse or its host is Databend Cloud's, whose older form reaches a warehouse with Warehouse
 * empty (section 4.4 of its provider doc); a self-hosted node without a Warehouse keeps its pulse.
 *
 * Nothing here connects: `createDatabaseProvider` builds each provider over
 * `CENSUS_CONNECTION`'s unconnected configuration, and `getCapabilities()` is a declaration.
