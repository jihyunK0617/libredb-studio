/**
 * Maps a connection to the options the Databend transport opens with (design 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.12, 3.14, 6.3): the
 * origin dialled and the far end named, the latch key, the TLS material, the headers set once per connection, the
 * closed list of per-request header names, the bounds and the secret forms. No socket opens here: every refusal is a
 * DatabaseConfigError raised before any transport is built, and none repeats the value it refuses. `connect()` is the
 * authority, since a seed or an API call never passes the dialog's checks.
 *
 * Every field read is checked before it is used, because a connection sent to the API arrives as the caller wrote
 * it: a field that is not the type `DatabaseConnection` declares is refused, naming the field. A null reads as
 * absent, as does an empty string, which the dialog writes for a blank box.
 *
 * Authorization is Basic on every request, with an empty password when none is set: Databend answers a request with
 * no Authorization header 401 with 5100 even for a `no_password` user (I10, UC1, UC2). The credential travels in
 * that one header and nowhere else. The user-agent names Studio and never a browser word, which Databend reads as
 * its worksheet mode; the client caps ask for the client session of design 3.4.
 *
 * Through an SSH tunnel the origin dialled is the local forward, while the endpoint a sentence names, the host the
 * plaintext rule judges, the identity a certificate is checked against and the latch key are the tunnel's far end
 * (X03).
 *
 * The parameter is named `config` on purpose: tests/unit/lib/db-ui-config.test.ts finds which addressing fields a
 * provider reads by the `config.<field>` pattern.
