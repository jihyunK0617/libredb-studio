 * refreshes statistics with ANALYZE TABLE and removes old data files with VACUUM TABLE, and Studio sends neither
 * (`maintenanceOperations` is `["kill"]`), so those cards are never drawn and are worded true all the same. The
 * slow-query state names `system_history` and its grant; the sessions state names the warehouse-wide scope of
 * `system.processes` [11 #13]; the table-stats caption names the default catalog the monitoring reads cover [X35].
 *
 * Pure: it imports the types only, so `getLabels()` can answer before connect.
