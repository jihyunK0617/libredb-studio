/**
 * The sign-in latch of design 3.5: once Databend refuses a sign-in, this Studio process sends that password to that
 * server again only after 15 minutes, or after the credential changes; another replica keeps a latch of its own
 * (`docs/BACKLOG.md` D252).
 *
 * Databend counts failed sign-ins only for a user under a password policy, and five in 15 minutes lock that user for
 * 15 minutes, during which the right password is refused too (measured, L10). Studio retries on its own (the pulse,
 * the fleet check, a tree read and a probe sent at once on activation), and a failed `connect()` is never cached, so
 * the latch lives in the process, not in a provider: two instances on one key share it, a disconnect does not clear
 * it, and a restart does.
 *
 * The key is an HMAC-SHA-256, keyed by 32 random bytes the process draws once, over the length-framed scheme, far end,
 * bastion route, user and password [X03], so a key seen outside the process, in a heap snapshot or a log line, cannot
 * be used to test a guessed password (the pattern of src/lib/auth-compare.ts). The far end is
 * the tunnel's when an SSH tunnel carries the connection, never the local forward, which is a new port for every
 * tunnel and every Test Connection; its host is framed in one spelling, so one server written two ways is one key.
 * The warehouse is not framed, because the user is locked whatever compute is named. No secret is kept: the map holds
 * digests.
 *
 * Single flight [X14]: until a key has had an answer, one attempt holds it, from its POST to its last close. Another
 * acquire waits inside its own signal and is refused unsent if the first latches; a proven key never waits. Only an
 * answer read as one proves a key, never a refusal, whatever its status; an attempt released with neither a proof nor
 * a latch hands the key to the next waiter.
 *
 * At most 256 entries, each lasting 15 minutes: a new entry first drops every expired one, then the oldest proven
 * one, and the oldest latched one only when every entry is latched and live [X30]. A proof is never kept at the cost
 * of a latch: with every entry latched and live it is not written, and its key stays unproven.
